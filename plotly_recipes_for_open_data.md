## Background

Plot.ly offers a very low barrier of adoption for government agencies who would like to easily visualize important data.  This project seeks to collect a range of very simple recipes for formatted data and plot.ly visualizations that can then automatically represent them.  

## How to Contribute

For the purposes of this project, an important characteristic of plot.ly is the ability to easily consume a hosted data file by merely appending the dataset's URL to a plot.ly URL, e.g. `https://plot.ly/external/?url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/open/data/fy12-onward-rib-filed-via-internet.csv`.    
  
The goal is to reduce any sample datasets down to a small but representative version of itself.  If a working example is fed by a dataset with 10,000 rows but the example can just as readily be conveyed with a dataset that consists of the first 5 rows only, then reducing the dataset's complexity, the example can be made all the more digestible and readily repurposed by new users.
